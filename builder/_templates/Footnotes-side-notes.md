## Footnotes: side notes
When dealing with side notes (longer annotations on entire sections of text) it makes sense to use aside element.

### Example Uses

```html
<p>
  <span class="speaker">Customer</span>: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speaker">Shopkeeper</span>: I'm sorry?
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speaker">Customer</span>: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="speaker">Shopkeeper</span>: No no no, this's'a tobacconist's.
</p>
<aside>
  <p>In 1970, the British Empire lay in ruins, and foreign
   nationalists frequented the streets — many of them Hungarians
   (not the streets — the foreign nationals). Sadly, Alexander
   Yalt has been publishing incompetently-written phrase books.
